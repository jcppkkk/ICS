Setup
-----

git clone <repo>
	clone the repository specified by <repo>; this is similar to "checkout" in
	some other version control systems such as Subversion and CVS

Add colors to your ~/.gitconfig file:

	[color]
		ui = auto
	[color "branch"]
		current = yellow reverse
		local = yellow
		remote = green
	[color "diff"]
		meta = yellow bold
		frag = magenta bold
		old = red bold
		new = green bold
	[color "status"]
		added = yellow
		changed = green
		untracked = cyan

Highlight whitespace in diffs

	[color]
		ui = true
	[color "diff"]
		whitespace = red reverse
	[core]
		whitespace=fix,-indent-with-non-tab,trailing-space,cr-at-eol

Add aliases to your ~/.gitconfig file:

	[alias]
		st = status
		ci = commit
		br = branch
		co = checkout
		df = diff
		lg = log -p


Configuration
-------------

git config --global user.name 'John Doe'
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
	sets your name and email for commit messages

git config branch.autosetupmerge true
	tells git-branch and git-checkout to setup new branches so that git-pull(1)
	will appropriately merge from that remote branch.  Recommended.  Without this,
	you will have to add --track to your branch command or manually merge remote
	tracking branches with "fetch" and then "merge".

You can add "--global" after "git config" to any of these commands to make it
apply to all git repos (writes to ~/.gitconfig).


Info
----

git diff
	show a diff of the changes made since your last commit
	to diff one file "git diff -- <filename>"

git status
	show files added to the staging area, files with changes, and untracked files

git log
	show recent commits, most recent on top. Useful options:
	--color       with color
	--graph       with an ASCII-art commit graph on the left
	--decorate    with branch and tag names on appropriate commits
	--stat        with stats (files changed, insertions, and deletions)
	-p            with full diffs
	--author=foo  only by a certain author
	--after="MMM DD YYYY" ex. ("Jun 20 2008") only commits after a certain date
	--before="MMM DD YYYY" only commits that occur before a certain date
	--merge       only the commits involved in the current merge conflicts

git show <rev>
	show the changeset (diff) of a commit specified by <rev>, which can be any
	SHA1 commit ID, branch name, or tag (shows the last commit (HEAD) by default)

git blame <file>
	show who authored each line in <file>

git blame <file> <rev>
	show who authored each line in <file> as of <rev> (allows blame to go back in
	time)

git gui blame
	really nice GUI interface to git blame

git whatchanged <file>
	show only the commits which affected <file> listing the most recent first


Adding / Deleting
-----------------

git add <file1> <file2> ...
	add <file1>, <file2>, etc... to the project

git add <dir>
	add all files under directory <dir> to the project, including subdirectories

git add .
	add all files under the current directory to the project

git rm <file1> <file2> ...
	remove <file1>, <file2>, etc... from the project

git rm $(git ls-files --deleted)
	remove all deleted files from the project

git rm --cached <file1> <file2> ...
	commits absence of <file1>, <file2>, etc... from the project


Staging
-------

git add <file1> <file2> ...
git stage <file1> <file2> ...
	add changes in <file1>, <file2> ... to the staging area (to be included in
	the next commit

git add -i
git stage -i
	interactively add files/changes to the staging area

git add -p
git stage -p
	interactively walk through the current changes in the working tree, and
	decide which changes to add to the staging area.


Committing
----------

git commit <file1> <file2> ... [-m <msg>]
	commit <file1>, <file2>, etc..., optionally using commit message <msg>,
	otherwise opening your editor to let you type a commit message

git commit -a
	commit all files changed since your last commit

git commit -v
	commit verbosely, i.e. includes the diff of the contents being committed in
	the commit message screen

git commit --amend <file1> <file2> ...
	redo previous commit, including changes made to <file1>, <file2>, etc...
	Also lets you edit the commit message of the previous commit.

Branching
---------

git branch
	list all local branches

git branch -r
	list all remote branches

git branch -a
	list all local and remote branches

git branch <branch>
	create a new branch named <branch>, referencing the same point in history as
	the current branch

git branch <branch> <start-point>
	create a new branch named <branch>, referencing <start-point>, which may be
	specified any way you like, including using a branch name or a tag name

git branch --track <branch> <remote-branch>
	create a tracking branch. Will push/pull changes to/from another repository.
	Example: git branch --track experimental origin/experimental

git branch -d <branch>
	delete the branch <branch>; if the branch you are deleting points to a commit
	which is not reachable from the current branch, this command will fail with a
	warning.

git branch -r -d <remote-branch>
	delete a remote-tracking branch.
	Example: git branch -r -d wycats/master

git branch -D <branch>
	even if the branch points to a commit not reachable from the current branch,
	you may know that that commit is still reachable from some other branch or
	tag. In that case it is safe to use this command to force git to delete the
	branch.

git checkout <branch>
	make the current branch <branch>, updating the working directory to reflect
	the version referenced by <branch>

git checkout -b <new> <start-point>
	create a new branch <new> referencing <start-point>, and check it out.

git push <repository> :<branch>
	removes a branch from a remote repository.
	Example: git push origin :old_branch_to_be_deleted


Merging
-------

git merge <branch>
	merge branch <branch> into the current branch; this command is idempotent and
	can be run as many times as needed to keep the current branch up-to-date with
	changes in <branch>

git merge <branch> --no-commit
	merge branch <branch> into the current branch, but do not autocommit the
	result; allows you to make further tweaks

git merge <branch> -s ours
	merge branch <branch> into the current branch, but drops any changes in
	<branch>, using the current tree as the new tree

Cherry-Picking
--------------

git cherry-pick [--edit] [-n] [-m parent-number] [-s] [-x] <commit>
	selectively merge a single commit from another local branch
	Example: git cherry-pick 7300a6130d9447e18a931e898b64eefedea19544


Conflicts
---------

git mergetool
	work through conflicted files by opening them in your mergetool (opendiff,
	kdiff3, etc.) and choosing left/right chunks. The merged result is staged for
	commit.

For binary files or if mergetool won't do, resolve the conflict(s) manually and
then do:

	git add <file1> [<file2> ...]

Once all conflicts are resolved and staged, commit the pending merge with:

	git commit


Sharing
-------

git fetch <remote>
	update the remote-tracking branches for <remote> (defaults to "origin").
	Does not initiate a merge into the current branch (see "git pull" below).

git pull
	fetch changes from the server, and merge them into the current branch.
	Note: .git/config must have a [branch "some_name"] section for the current
	branch, to know which remote-tracking branch to merge into the current
	branch.  Git 1.5.3 and above adds this automatically.

git push
	update the server with your commits across all branches that are *COMMON*
	between your local copy and the server.  Local branches that were never pushed
	to the server in the first place are not shared.

git push origin <branch>
	update the server with your commits made to <branch> since your last push.
	This is always *required* for new branches that you wish to share.  After the
	first explicit push, "git push" by itself is sufficient.


Reverting
---------

git revert <rev>
	reverse commit specified by <rev> and commit the result.  This does *not* do
	the same thing as similarly named commands in other VCS's such as "svn revert"
	or "bzr revert", see below

git checkout <file>
	re-checkout <file>, overwriting any local changes

git checkout .
	re-checkout all files, overwriting any local changes.  This is most similar to
	"svn revert" if you're used to Subversion commands


Fix mistakes / Undo
-------------------

git reset --hard
	abandon everything since your last commit; this command can be DANGEROUS.  If
	merging has resulted in conflicts and you'd like to just forget about the
	merge, this command will do that.

git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD
	undo your most recent *successful* merge *and* any changes that occurred
	after.  Useful for forgetting about the merge you just did.  If there are
	conflicts (the merge was not successful), use "git reset --hard" (above)
	instead.

git reset --soft HEAD^
	forgot something in your last commit? That's easy to fix. Undo your last
	commit, but keep the changes in the staging area for editing.

git commit --amend
	redo previous commit, including changes you've staged in the meantime.
	Also used to edit commit message of previous commit.


Plumbing
--------

test <sha1-A> = $(git merge-base <sha1-A> <sha1-B>)
	determine if merging sha1-B into sha1-A is achievable as a fast forward;
	non-zero exit status is false.


Stashing
--------

git stash save <optional-name>
	save your local modifications to a new stash (so you can for example
	"git svn rebase" or "git pull")

git stash apply
	restore the changes recorded in the stash on top of the current working tree
	state

git stash pop
	restore the changes from the most recent stash, and remove it from the stack
	of stashed changes

git stash list
	list all current stashes

git stash show <stash-name> -p
	show the contents of a stash - accepts all diff args

git stash clear
	delete current stashes

Remotes
-------

git remote add <remote> <remote_URL>
	adds a remote repository to your git config.  Can be then fetched locally.
	Example:
		git remote add coreteam git://github.com/wycats/merb-plugins.git
		git fetch coreteam

git push <remote> :refs/heads/<branch>
	delete a branch in a remote repository

git push <remote> <remote>:refs/heads/<remote_branch>
	create a branch on a remote repository
	Example: git push origin origin:refs/heads/new_feature_name

git push <repository> +<remote>:<new_remote>
	create a branch on a remote repository based on +<remote>
	Example: git push origin +master:my_branch


git remote prune <remote>
	prune deleted remote-tracking branches from "git branch -r" listing


Submodules
----------

git submodule add <remote_repository> <path/to/submodule>
	add the given repository at the given path. The addition will be part of the
	next commit.

git submodule update <--init>
	Update the registered submodules (clone missing submodules, and checkout
	the commit specified by the super-repo). --init is needed the first time.

git submodule foreach <command>
	Executes the given command within each checked out submodule.


Git Instaweb
------------

git instaweb --httpd=webrick <--start> <--stop> <--restart>
